Where vulnerability is strength. Where future meets emotion. Where softness and edge exist side by side.

🌟 About Fragile Base
Fragile Base is a contemporary fashion and accessories brand that celebrates duality — the coexistence of vulnerability and strength, softness and edge, emotion and armor. Founded with roots in both Switzerland and Tokyo, Fragile Base creates statement pieces that challenge conventional fashion boundaries.
​
